      content="Psychological counseling can help
	  if you are dissatisfied with the current situation,
	  feels burdened or does not know how to proceed.
	  It helps to find solutions and new ways.
	  There can be a very specific goal here, or we can work out a goal in consultation.
	  I can guide you through difficult times with empathy and thoughtfulness,
	  Accompany life crises and new challenges.
	  As a psychologist, it is important to me
	  always complying with professional ethics and scientific standards."

									<h3>What is singing therapy?</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Gesangstherapie01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										You might already know the concept of talk therapy. 
										You talk about what is on your mind, what is bothering you. 
										However, sometimes talking is not enough; sometimes words 
										cannot describe what is really going on, deep inside us.
									</p>
									<p>Then singing therapy can help. Here, the voice in its entirety is the tool. It serves as a valve, as means of expression, catalyst, bridge to the unconscious.</p>

									<p>	The most important thing about it: You do not have to be able to sing! 
										Even if you are actually good at it, you do not have to worry 
										about how you may sound. 
										There is no judgment, no right or wrong. Simply be and chime.
									</p>
								
									<hr/>
									<p>
										<h3>Single Setting</h3>
										What happens in a singing therapy session? That really depends on 
										with which topics and wishes you approach me. We can sing healing 
										songs or mantras. One melody or polyphonic harmonies - there are no 
										limits to creativity and plenty of room for improvisation. 
										The free chiming is a big part of singing therapy as there is the biggest 
										freedom for individual expression. 
										However, nothing is an obligation. In the end, you should always feel comfortable.
									</p>
									<p>	<span class="image right"><img src="images/isgc logo.png" alt="" /></span>
										Additionally to active singing therapy, there is also the receptive one. 
										Here the focus is on being sung at while you can completely let go, 
										relax and enjoy.
									</p>
									<p>	The goal is always to create a space, in which you feel accepted and safe. 
										Where you can just be yourself. Everything is right; 
										you do not have to fulfil any expectations and can give away your burden.
									</p>

									<hr />
									<p>
										<h3>Which topics can you work on?</h3> 
										<p>On the psychological level:</p>
										<li>All emotions (e.g. anger, sadness), discover, express and dissolve them</li>
										<li>Work with the inner child </li>
										<li>Release blockages </li>
										<li>Find/heal your own voice </li>
										<li>Recognizing and expressing needs </li>
										<li>Self-acceptance and self-love </li>
										<li>Stage fright </li>
										<li>Support with mental disorders (e.g. anxiety, depression, music performance anxiety) </li>
									</p>
									<p>
										<p>On the physiological level:</p> 
										<li>Support with breathing problems</li> 
										<li>Support of the immune system (e.g. with autoimmune diseases)</li>
										<li>Support with voice and speaking problems (e.g. hoarseness, stuttering)</li>
										<li>Support with psychosomatic issues (e.g. chronic pain, indigestion)</li>
										<li>Singing while pregnant and birth</li>
									</p>

									<hr />
									<p>
										<h3>Group Setting</h3>
										Together we will explore our own voices and their healing potential.
									</p>
									<p>	We sing songs from all around the world and different cultures. 
										Additionally we practice mindfulness and relaxing exercises, 
										free dancing, everything connected by a touch of playfulness. 
										It is about the collective enjoying of being completely free, 
										letting the voices connect and getting the happiness hormones out.
									</p>
									<p>	Here as well, no singing experience is 
										required and no one has to sing on their own in front of the others.
									</p>

									<hr />
									<p>
										<h3>What is singing therapy NOT?</h3>
										Singing therapy is not a singing lesson. 
										It is not about technique or singing “beautifully”. 
									</p>
									<p>	It is also no psychotherapy and no substitute for it. 
										Clients are responsible to get themselves the 
										psychotherapeutic help that they need. Of course, 
										I can support you with that.
