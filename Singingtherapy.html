									<h3>What is singing therapy?</h3>
									Probably everybody knows the principle of psychotherapy. You talk about what's bothering you, what's stressing you out. 
									But sometimes talking is not enough, sometimes words can't describe what's really going on, deep inside us.<br>

									Then singing therapy can help. Here the voice in its entirety is the tool.<br>
									It's used as a valve, means of expression, catalyst, bridge to the soul and the unconscious.<br>

									The most important thing about it: You don't have to be able to sing!<br>
									There is no judgment, no right or wrong. Simply be. Singing also releases many happiness hormones, reduces stress and has a freeing effect.

									<h3>Single Setting</h3>
									What happens in a singing therapy session? <br>
									That really depends on with which topics and wishes you approach me. 
									There is the opportunity to sing healing songs or mantras.
									One melody or polyphonic harmonies - there are no limits to creativity. 
									The free toning is a big part of singing therapy as there is the biggest freedom for individual expression. But nothing is an obligation. 
									In the end you should always feel good.<br>

									Additionally to active singing therapy there is also the receptive one. <br>

									healing singing<br>
									Singing simple songs or mantras with plenty of room for improvisation<br>
									free tones

									<h3>Which topics can you work on?</h3> 
									<p>On the psychological level:</p>
									<li>Expressing all emotions (anger, sadness, etc.), giving them a voice, being able to let them out</li>
									<li>Inner child </li>
									<li>Release blockages </li>
									<li>find your own voice </li>
									<li>Recognize and express feelings and needs </li>
									<li>Self acceptance, self love </li>
									<li>Support with mental disorders (e.g. anxiety disorders, depression) </li>
								</p>
								<p>
									<p>On the psychological level:</p> 
									<li>Support with breathing problems</li> 
									<li>Support of the immune system (e.g. with autoimmune diseases)</li>
									<li>Support with psychosomatic complaints, e.g. pain, digestive disorders</li>
									<li>Singing while pregnant and birth</li>
								</p>
								<hr />
								<p>
									<h3>Group Setting</h3>
									Collective creative exploring of your own voice and its healing potential.
									We sing songs from all around the world and different cultures. 
									Additionally we practice mindfulness and relaxing exercises, free moving, 
									everything connected by a touch of  playfulness. 
									It's about the collective enjoying of being completely free, 
									letting the voices connect and bringing out the happiness hormones. :-)
									Here is also no singing experience required and no one has to sing on their own.
								</p>
								<hr />
								<p>
									<h3>What is singing therapy NOT?</h3>
									Singing therapy is not a singing lesson. 
									It's not about technique or singing “beautifully”. 
									It is also no psychotherapy and no substitute for it. 
									Clients are responsible to get themselves the psychotherapeutic help that they need.
