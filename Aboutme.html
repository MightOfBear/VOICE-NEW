							<h3>Hello,</h3>
								
							<p>it's good to see you.</p>
							
							<p>Growing up in peaceful lower Bavaria, my life has always been filled with music. 
								I have sung since I can remember, had lessons for many years, 
								started playing the piano when I was 6 and taught myself the guitar when I was 16.
								Since 2009 I have performed in many bands and studio projects as well as a wedding singer.
							</p>
								
							<p>After graduating I started studying psychology at the university of Salzburg and in 2020 I achieved a Bachelor of Science. 
								In summer 2022 I will finish my Master's and therefore officially be a psychologist. 
								During my studies I also completed a mentoring training program.
							</p>
								
							<p>My master thesis, which I am currently working on, … music. 
								It is based on the analysis of how bands cope with the often stressful situation of an upcoming show. 
								The goal is to develop methods and techniques which help musicians to optimally prepare for shows, 
								perform on an above average level and cope better with different kinds of anxiety (e.g. stage fright).
							</p>
								
							<p>In March 2021 I started my training to become a singing therapist at the ISGC in Vienna at Julia Hwesta-Spitzer 
								<a href="(www.singdichfrei.at)">(www.singdichfrei.at)</a>. In September 2021 I successfully completed the first part and am therefore a practitioner of singing therapy. 
								In March 2022 I will complete the second part of the training after which I'll be able to call myself a singing therapist.
							</p>
