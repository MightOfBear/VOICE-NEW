								<p>	<span class="image left"><img src="images/Uber mich 3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									I was born in Bavaria, Germany in 1993. 
									I grew up with my family there and finished my Abitur 
									(German A levels) in 2012.
								</p>

								<p>	Since I was a child I have been involved in all sorts of musical projects. 
									When I was 16 years old, I joined my first band as a singer. 
									I continued that as a side hustle throughout my studies. 
									During that time, I was able to make many beautiful experiences and learned a lot. 
									I have also been traveling through Bavaria as a wedding singer.
								</p>
									
								<p>	<span class="image right"><img src="images/Uber mich 4.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									2022 I finished my master's degree in psychology at the 
									Paris Lodron University of Salzburg as well as a mentoring training. 
									In the same year, I also completed the training to become a 
									singing therapist at the ISGC in Vienna 
									(run by Julia Hwesta-Spitzer, 
									<a href="(www.singdichfrei.at)">(www.singdichfrei.at)</a>
									). 
									October 2022 I will start my psychotherapy training with focus on 
									cognitive behavioural therapy.
								</p>
								
								<p>	In my free time, 
									I enjoy going to rock, metal and punk shows or making music myself. 
									I love variation, which is easily recognizable 
									looking at all the different hair colours.
								</p>
									
								<p>	<span class="image left"><img src="images/Uber mich 5.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									Discovering the concept of singing therapy was an exciting moment in my life. 
									The combination of music, singing and psychology is exactly the 
									intersection point of all my passions. 
									Helping people with music - I cannot imagine anything better. 
									However, I do also enjoy psychological counselling and look 
									forward to being able to offer psychotherapy. 
									My main concern is always the best possible treatment for my clients 
									and their needs.
								</p>

								<p>	Singing therapy as well as psychology are merely a base, 
									from which everyone chooses their own path. 
									My offer is for everyone who would like to try singing therapy or 
									psychological counselling. In particular however, it is meant for musicians, 
									artists and performers of all kind.
								</p>

								<p>	The pressure in the business can become straining very fast. 
									It can affect the voice and the body in general. 
									Anxiety, stage fright and other psychological symptoms can emerge.
								</p>

								<p>	Singing therapy offers an opportunity for expression without valuation. 
									There is no right or wrong, only free singing without any pressure to perform. 
									There is also the possibility of being sung at, 
									which is always a quite personal and intense experience.
								</p>

								<p>	In psychological counselling, talking is the main method. 
									We can talk about everything that burdens you: Worries, 
									fears but also wishes and goals. The combination of psychological 
									counselling and singing therapy is of course possible as well.
								</p>

								<p>	In the respective sections for singing therapy and psychological counselling, 
									you will find more detailed information regarding my offers.
