										<h2><a href="#">Psychological counseling & coaching</a></h2>
										<p>	Are you dissatisfied with the current situation? Are you looking for a new way? 
											Perhaps you would also like to get more in touch with your emotions or work towards a very specific goal? 
											Then take a look at my offers for psychological counseling and coaching.</p>

								<h3>Psychological Counseling</h3>
								<p>	I will guide you sensitively and thoughtfully through difficult times, 
									life crises and new challenges. 
									As a prospective psychologist (master's degree in summer 2022), 
									I can support you with the necessary specialist knowledge in a competent and sensitive manner to bring your 
									life back into balance and to work through these times as best as possible.</p>
									
								<p>	Psychological counseling is not intended to treat or diagnose mental disorders, 
									as psychotherapy does. It takes effect earlier, 
									before a disorder even occurs, and is therefore a preventive and supportive method.</p>
									
								<p>	It is suitable for all people who are going through a difficult phase in their life, be it personal, 
									family or professional.</p>
								
								<h3>Coaching</h3>
								<p>	Do you have a vision, a goal or would you like to develop one?</br>
									For people who are willing to try new things and enjoy coming up with creative solutions, 
									coaching is a wonderful way to get the best out of them.</br>
									I'll show you how to strengthen your strengths, promote your resources, 
									use them in a targeted manner and become the best version of yourself.</br>
									Achieve goals, successfully overcome challenges and make better 
									use of your everyday life in order to achieve top performance.</p>
